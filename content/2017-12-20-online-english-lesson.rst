I re-realized that I need to practice English more. I can probably
polish my reading and writing skill with IRC, Twitter, ML, etc. If I
want to polish my listening and speaking skill, there are some
resources such as podcasts, self online trainings, etc. And I keep
listening to some English podcasts everyday. However, speaking part, I
don't practice that much, actually.

So, I started to quick scan the best online English lesson for
me. So, I'll share the information here.

Native teachers
===============

* `Spoken`_

  * Private English Lessons, Anytime!
  * I can use any chat apps like LINE, WE CHAT, WHATS APP, etc.
  * The lessons are held during 8AM-10PM UTC-5 only. It's 10PM-12PM
    JST.
  * $69.99/month (depends on the frequency of the lesson and
    subscription length)

* `iTalki <http://promos.italki.com/allearsenglish/>`_

  * An easy way to find a qualified native English teacher fast!
  * This might cost over $100~200/month to get 3 lessons/week.

Non native English teachers
===========================

* `Native Camp <https://nativecamp.net/>`_

  * Mostly, Filipina
  * I can get lesson anytime, like **All we can get** system.
  * $49/month (very cheap)

* `DMM 英会話 <http://eikaiwa.dmm.com/plan/>`_

  * Teachers live in 89 countries.
  * There's a **plus native** plan. I can get lessons of native
    speakers easier with this plan. But it's not fixed.
  * $50/month (standard plan)
  * $150/month (plus native plan)

* `kakaku.com: Comparison of online English lessons running by Japanese companies
  <http://eikaiwa.kakaku.com/online_english/>`_ (NOTE: The information are written by Japanese.)

  * This site information is really useful if you wanted to know
    online English lessons running by Japanese companies.

Summary
=======

I'm not decided to take a course yet. But I'm thinking to try
`Spoken`_ first. The lesson timeslots are bit tight. But I can fit
that. Hope I will share the result of the lesson :)
