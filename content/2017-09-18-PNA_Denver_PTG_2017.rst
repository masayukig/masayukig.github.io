I'd like to run a retrospective myself against the PTG in Denver, briefly.

Positive
========

* keep to have conversation with QA and the other people
* got new conversation with QA and some people
* had a lot of fun time in a social meeting
* (almost) only one pub was very convenient :)
* got productive time
* got to know new QA related things like Zuul v3/o-h, OPNFV testing
* got a Happy hour with Parrots

Negative
========

* still very poor English, conversation skill, it didn't often go well.
* still poor technical skill
* tooooo much drunk
* very hectic on the last day (Saturday)
* in very bad jet lag days

Action
======

* Learn and train English and conversation skill

  * I'm thinking to take online English classes

* try to drink more soft drinks or water
* work harder to improve technical skills with fun
* book more relaxing flights next
