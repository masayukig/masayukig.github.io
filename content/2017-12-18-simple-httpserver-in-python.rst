Every time I'd like to use a http server in development such as
checking generated HTML documentation files, I need to google how to
do it. So I post a blog as a memorandum.

`Python2`_
==========

::

  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer [PORT]
  # default port is 8000
  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...

`Python3`_
==========

::

  $ python3 -m http.server [PORT]
  # default port is 8000
  Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
