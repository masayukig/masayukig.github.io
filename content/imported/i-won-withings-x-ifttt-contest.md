Yeah! I'm really happy to see this.

I read the article a few weeks ago:
<http://blog.withings.com/en/2012/10/17/ifttt-x-withings-contest-imagine-the-most-usefuluseless-recipe/>
And I seek the recipe about Withings x Google Calendar. But I could not
find out.
So I imagined this recipe. This recipe is used 53 times! This is my best
score about ifttt.

But actually, this recipe has a few problems..
That is about

1.  time zone(?)
2.  the data itself

1.
For example, when I weighed my weight at "Nov 8 22:31 JST 2012", but the
datetime of Google Calendar is "Nov 9 22:31 JST 2012".
The difference is about 24 hours!

2.
For example, my data on the Google Calendar is
"November 08, 2012 at Weight: 14lb / 6kg Lean mass: 117 lb / 53 kg Fat
mass: 21 lb / 13.07 kg Body fat: 18 %"
But I'm not a baby :-). 6kg is tooooo light for me. And Body fat "18%"
is not correct.

Maybe something is wrong my recipe, Withings and/or IFTTT. But I don't
know what is the cause.

If somebody knows the cause, please let me know that.
