I have some feelings about keeping my contribution through a month on
`My GitHub profile <https://github.com/masayukig/>`_.

What's the tricks?
==================

* Have your own github repositories and contribute them.
* Dump out everything to the github repositories as possible.
* Forget the limitation. We can commit everything to github repositories even if your blog posts.

What are the Positive/Negative/Action Items?
============================================

Positive
--------

* Almost green!

Negtive
-------

* Only white on Dec. 13

  * It was green for some days. But it was turned to white suddenly. This might be caused by this rule: https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile/

* Not only actual code but also issues and blog posts

Action
------
* Keep it, anyway. Even if it'll be a blog post or issue.
* Mixed contribution like issues, comments, push patches are better to avoid an accident.
* Try to write more code.


Happy Hacking!
