I've got the `X-Bows Mechanical Ergonomic Keyboard`_, and I'm still
using and confusing about it now.
Almost keys are good for me, but I'm struggle with some keys such as
`-, =, ), [], space, backslash, enter, backspace and B, Z, etc` keys
are really annoying for me right now.

I'm using Emacs and Ctrl+B key a lot, but I often push the Enter
key... :(

Anyway, I need to practice to get used to it more.
