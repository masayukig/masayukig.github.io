I just got the `X-Bows Mechanical Ergonomic Keyboard`_, yeah, the
shape is a bit weird and it's a bit annoying to get use to, actually..

However, it realized me that my hands position was really bad. And,
I think/believe doing new things are really good for my brain.

And also, this keyboard is silent compare to normal mechanical
keyboards. Touch feeling is also good to me, not so heavy, not so
light. I feel this is really good for my health.

But not sure, someone might say "your key typing is very noisy"
someday. If I get like that thing, I need to re-think my keyboard
strategy.
