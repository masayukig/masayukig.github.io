Introduction
------------

This is a retrospective about this blog mainly.

Positive
--------

* My eyes are still on this blog.

Negative
--------

* I couldn't have continued to post regularly.

  * Language barrier

    * I prefer to use Japanese rather than English
  * Tooling barrier

    * Generate with Pelican is not so easy. Especially on smartphone?


Action
------

* Allow me to use not only English but also Japanese for my posts if
  it's better. (I'm not sure about this..)
* Use my smartphone to dump out my ideas.
* I'm waiting for my Gemini PDA :) It should be useful for writing texts.

Happy Hacking!
