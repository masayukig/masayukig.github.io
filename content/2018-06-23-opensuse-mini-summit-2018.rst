I had `a talk`_ at the `openSUSE mini Summit 2018`_ about `my private
cloud`. I had build this for my personal testing. This cloud is enough
for my use but it's costy for running due to the electricity. So, I'm
thinking to use more efficient machines like Raspberry Pi or something
like that. I think NUC boxes are better but costy for the initial
cost..
